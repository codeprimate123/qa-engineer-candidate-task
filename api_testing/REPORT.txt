Brief findings:

- GET method on /posts endpoint works as expected
- POST method on /posts endpoint fails to add a new post, even thou the return code 
  implies succesful addition and even a new id is generated for the data entry
- PUT method on /posts/id endpoint fails to modify the post with given id even thou response implies success
- DELETE method on posts/id endpoint fails to delete the post with given id even thou response implies success

Considering the purpose of the site the tests are somewhat "naive" as the site is made with immutable data on purpose,
but for the purpose of the task I pretended the site should behave as expected according to the made requests.
